bootSVD
=======

The R package bootSVD can be used to implement fast, exact bootstrap principal component analysis and singular value decompositions for high dimensional data (i.e. >1 million measurements per subject). The primary function in this package is the bootSVD function, for which we include a documented example based on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) data.

This package is based on the methodology outlined in:
